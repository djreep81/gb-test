# Importers

{% hint style="info" %}
 All importers \(staff, gl codes, paysheets, timesheets\) are imported via ruby importers.  The process code can be all found in lib/import/exd\_ap\_staff.rb
{% endhint %}

## Import Staff

```
$ give me super-powers
```

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
